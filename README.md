IIIF Training Workbench

## Source
IIIF images uploaded using [https://workbench.gdmrdigital.com/]

That creates Level 0 IIIF images using a folder structure under the /images/ folder. For image named deleteme_too.jpg this produces info.json at e.g. [https://cookjools.github.io/iiif-course-images/images/deleteme_too/info.json ]

and full sized image at [https://cookjools.github.io/iiif-course-images/images/deleteme_too/full/full/0/default.jpg ]
